          <h2>What are the historic terms of the Treaty, meaning what was included in the Treaty?</h2>
          <p>Treaty 1, like many historical treaties, had some important terms. Here are some of the key things included in the Treaty:</p>
            <ul><li><p class="bulletPoints">Land Sharing:</p></li></ul><p>The Indigenous people agreed to share their land with the Canadian government. In exchange, the government promised to provide reserves where Indigenous families could live, hunt, and fish. These reserves were like special areas set aside for them.</p>
            <ul><li><p class="bulletPoints">Payments:</p></li></ul><p>The government agreed to give the Indigenous families money, which they called annuities. These payments were made every year to help the families. The amount was set in the treaty.</p>
            <ul><li><p class="bulletPoints">Education and Healthcare:</p></li></ul><p>The government promised to provide schools and healthcare services for the Indigenous people living on the reserves.</p>
            <ul><li><p class="bulletPoints">Hunting and Fishing Rights:</p></li></ul><p>The Indigenous people were allowed to continue hunting and fishing on the land they didn't give up. This was important for their way of life and culture.</p>
            <ul><li><p class="bulletPoints">Peace and Friendship:</p></li></ul><p>Both sides promised to be friends and live peacefully. The Indigenous people agreed not to make trouble with settlers, and the government promised to protect the Indigenous people and their way of life.</p>
