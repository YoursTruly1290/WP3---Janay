          <h2>What makes this Treaty different from other Treaties in Canada?</h2>
          <p>Treaty 1 is like a unique handshake agreement between the Canadian government and specific Indigenous groups in a special area (Manitoba). What makes it different from other treaties is that it was made in a different place with different Indigenous nations, so the rules and promises in Treaty 1 are not exactly the same as in other treaties. It's a bit like how you and your friends might have different games and rules when you play in different places. So, each treaty is special and specific to the people and land it involves.</p>

          <h2>How is the Treaty implemented today?</h2>
          <p>Today, treaties like Treaty 1 are still important, and they're used to make sure that Indigenous communities have a good life. Here's how they work now:</p>
            <ul><li><p class="bulletPoints">Urban Reserves:</p></li></ul><p>Some Indigenous communities have special areas within cities, called urban reserves. These reserves are like a piece of their traditional land in the city. They can use these areas for housing, businesses, and cultural activities. It's a way for Indigenous people to keep their culture alive, even in the city.</p>
            <ul><li><p class="bulletPoints">Economic Development:</p></li></ul><p>Treaties also help Indigenous communities with businesses and jobs. For example, some communities have gas stations, stores, or other businesses. These businesses can provide jobs and money to support the community. So, treaties help with economic development, making life better for the people in those communities.</p>
            <p>Treaties are not just old agreements; they are still used today to support the well-being and growth of Indigenous communities.</p>
