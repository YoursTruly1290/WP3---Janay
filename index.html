      <td><p>Treaty 1, also known as the "Stone Fort Treaty," is like a special agreement between some Indigenous people and the government of Canada. They made this agreement a long time ago on August 3rd, 1871. The place where they talked and made this agreement is called Lower Fort Garry. It's like an old building near a river in a town called Selkirk north of Winnipeg.</p></td>
