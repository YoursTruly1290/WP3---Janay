          <h2>Where was the Treaty 1 negotiated?</h2>
          <p>Treaty 1, also known as the <span style="color: #184CB9;">"Stone Fort Treaty,"</span> is like a special agreement between some Indigenous people and the government of Canada. They made this agreement a long time ago on August 3rd, 1871. The place where they talked and made this agreement is called Lower Fort Garry. It's like an old building near a river in a town called Selkirk north of Winnipeg.</p>

There is a title ‘Numbered Treaties in Canada’ in a sans-serif font in black colour. The USA and Alaska is not shown in this map. And where the oceans and the USA land is supposed to be is all white blank background. Each of the treaties number is listed in bold white font and the year the treaty was negotiated is just under it in normal font. Treaties 1,2 and 3’s area was not big enough so there is a ‘chat box’ in black with white font listed under the treaties." />
